Into the modern area of blogging? Or rather, the techo-literati's blogging "app"? Or neither...for whom are github pages + jeykll? I like the static page-based approach - mirrors my original foray into "blogging" (a.k.a. journaling) back in college with in-line posts in monthly html pages - and the markdown, but dislike the lack of spell checking. For the spelling-deficient among us, that's a problem. As I'm writting this in vim, I thankfully have a fallback, but I must turn it on! Such effort for such basic functionality! Perhaps we'll just leave misspellings in place as my uncommonly unoriginal idiosyncracy...probably spelled that wrong.

On to other things...such as finding/building a better jekyll theme
