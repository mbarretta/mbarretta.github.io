I write this from the [See See Motor Coffee Shop](https://www.seeseemotorcycles.com/blogs/coffee-shop) in (currently, anyway) sunny Reno, Nevada. This is the last day of a 7 day trip that took me to San Francisco for [Elastic{ON}](https://www.elastic.co/elasticon) last Wednesday through Friday, then to Lake Tahoe (right on the CA/NV boarder) through this Monday, and then here to Reno to fly back to Dulles. The Reno stay was increased by a day thanks to the "big" storm that hit the east coast Monday into Tuesday. To avoid any problems, I moved my home-flight to tomorrow (Wednesday).

So far, Reno is nice enough, though I had the worse eggplant parm sub of my life at [Michael's Deli](http://www.michaelsdeli-reno.com). I'm sure they do other stuff well, but that sandwich sucked, and I would think the same would be true for any of the sandwiches with that same marinara. Don't get me wrong, there was much else wrong the eggplant aside from the marinara, but it was closer in kin to katchup than "gravy".

It'll likely take weeks to unpack everything I learned over the last week. 

What will be?

I need to setup calls with each of the SAs and ask a series of structured questions. I need to talk with Dave about my job: who are my sales reps, what are our current and prospective deals, what's my quota, etc. Questions for SAs:
* What part of the stack do you know best?
* What use case(s) do you know best?
* In your opinion, what are the strengths of the various applications?
* Weaknesses?
* What are the most common questions you field?
* What are the most common problems/misunderstandings you encounter?
* What tips/tricks/lessons learned would you have wanted to know when you started?
* What should I ask that I haven't?

What else do I need?
* I need to get on sales calls, shadowing everywhere: look at people's calendars and ask
* I need to talk with Dave about primary fed/gov use cases
* I need to ask Dave if I'm focusing on DoD/IC or gov more broadly
* I need to ask Dave/Mayzak about clearance stuff: can I hit up Decision Lab and advocate directly?
